## 💡 The "Why" Behind Qadam AI

Qadam AI was born from real-life insights. After conducting interviews with dozens of high schoolers, we found that **80% of students** feel overwhelmed by the admission process. 

Our mission is to democratize educational consulting. After witnessing cases where students were defrauded by dishonest agencies, we decided to build a "Step-by-Step" (Qadam) tool that provides high-level guidance for free.
